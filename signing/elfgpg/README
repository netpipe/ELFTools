  This software is offered to you with no warranty.  It is released under 
  the terms and conditions of the GPL; see the COPYING files for details.


3. Dependencies

You will need to install libelf development package (or source + headers).
On Debian you can run:

	apt-get install libelfg0-dev libgpgme-dev

Currently this package has only been tested on Linux.  I don't expect it to 
be extremely portable at this time.

More to the point, I've built and tested it with the following Debian 
and Redhat configurations:

			Debian/testing	RedHat/7.2
	kernel      	2.4.20		2.4.20
	gcc         	2.95.4-17	2.96
	libc6-dev   	2.3.1-16	2.2.5-32
	libgpgme-dev	0.3.15-1	0.3.5-fr1
	libelfg0-dev	0.8.2-1		0.7.0-1


4. Bugs & Issues

  The is a list of known issues in the BUGS file.  If there are any other
  issues you have found, I would appreciate if you send me some details.
